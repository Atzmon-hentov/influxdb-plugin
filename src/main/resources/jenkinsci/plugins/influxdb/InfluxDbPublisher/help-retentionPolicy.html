Choose the retention policy for the data (i.e. how long is the data stored).
<br/><br/>
The default value for InfluxDB 1.0+ versions is "autogen". For InfluxDB versions &lt;1.0 the default retention policy is "default".
The "autogen" or "default" retention policies mean the data is stored for infinity.

The input can be set e.g. "2m", "3d", "4w", for 2 minutes, 3 days, or 4 weeks respectively.
